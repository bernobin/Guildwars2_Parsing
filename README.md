In the working directory you find

gw2_parser.py: This contains the structure used to extract generic data from the zevtc files.
sheets_updater.py: This contains the csv_to_googlesheet method that uploads the csv to a designated google_sheet for post-processing of the data

Other than that there is a folder for the different projects I had with friends since working on this code.

The current project can be found in "Qadim the Peerless" and best reflects the current state of the code. When the older projects finished I stopped updating their code (for the most part).
